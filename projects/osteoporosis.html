                                <h3>Background:</h3>
                                <p>Osteoporosis is the most prevalent chronic bone disease that is characterized by the loss of bone density, 
                                    deterioration of bone tissue, and it can lead to an increase in the risk of bone fragility (Klibanski et al. 201).
                                     From recent studies, although osteoporosis has been seen in all age groups, gender, and ethnicities, it is more in Caucasians, older people, and women.</p>
                                <p>The International Osteoporosis Foundation has recently released statistics showing that one in three women over the age of 50 and one in five men may have an osteoporosis fracture during their lifetime. Additionally, with the estimation that more than 200 million people are suffering from osteoporosis, it is believed that osteoporosis has increasingly become a global pandemic (SÃ¶zen et al. 2017). Therefore, increasing awareness about osteoporosis in the community and scientific research from health organizations worldwide is essential in preventing this pandemic. 
                                    his also leads to the motivation of choosing this topic for the purpose of this project. </p>
                                <h3>Dataset introduction:</h3>

                                <p>The dataset of osteoporosis disease is extracted from a cross-sectional study involving 300 postmenopausal Vietnamese women aged more than 50 who were randomly sampled from different districts in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This research is led by Dr. Tuan V Nguyen and other researchers to determine the contributing factors to osteoporosis. 
                                    This dataset consists of 300 records representing all women who are chosen for the study. There are ten features, and only one feature is categorical; the rest are numeric. The definition of this dataset is as follows. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on bone density measured by a DXA scan. The dataset can be accessed via

                                    <h3>Data pre-processing:</h3>
                                <p>The Entity relationship and class diagrams are conducted using Chen and UML notation. All the entities and relationship in ER diagrams are converted into logical and relational model at least in 3rd normal form.</p>
                                
                                <h3>Exploratory data analysis:</h3>
