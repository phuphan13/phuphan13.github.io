                                <h3>1. Background:</h3>
                                <p>Osteoporosis is the most prevalent chronic bone disease that is characterized by the loss of bone density, 
                                    deterioration of bone tissue, and it can lead to an increase in the risk of bone fragility (Klibanski et al. 201).
                                     From recent studies, although osteoporosis has been seen in all age groups, gender, and ethnicities, it is more in Caucasians, older people, and women.</p>
                                <p>The International Osteoporosis Foundation has recently released statistics showing that one in three women over the age of 50 and one in five men may have an osteoporosis fracture during their lifetime. Additionally, with the estimation that more than 200 million people are suffering from osteoporosis, it is believed that osteoporosis has increasingly become a global pandemic (SÃ¶zen et al. 2017). Therefore, increasing awareness about osteoporosis in the community and scientific research from health organizations worldwide is essential in preventing this pandemic. 
                                    his also leads to the motivation of choosing this topic for the purpose of this project. </p>
                                <h3>2. Dataset introduction:</h3>

                                <p>The dataset of osteoporosis disease is extracted from a cross-sectional study involving 300 postmenopausal Vietnamese women aged more than 50 who were randomly sampled from different districts in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This research is led by Dr. Tuan V Nguyen and other researchers to determine the contributing factors to osteoporosis. 
                                    This dataset consists of 300 records representing all women who are chosen for the study. There are ten features, and only one feature is categorical; the rest are numeric. The definition of this dataset is as follows. The diagnosis of osteoporosis is based on bone density measured by a DXA scan. The dataset can be accessed via 
                                    this <a href="https://github.com/tuanvnguyen/Regression-Book" target="_blank">Github link</a>.
									The meta data of this dataset can be found in the Github link of this project.  
								<h5>Example of dataset:</h5>
								<a href="../assets/images/projects/project3/dataset.png" class="image main"><img src="../assets/images/projects/project3/dataset.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the probability of being suffered from osteoporosis disease, either osteopenia (lower bone density) or osteoporosis (severe case of bone loss that can lead to fracture). </p>	
                                <h3>3. Methodology: </h3>
								<h4>3.1 Data pre-processing</h4>
                                
								<p>Dataset is first checked for types, and missing values only appear for two features
									height and weight with the proportion of 2.3% and 1.7% respectively. K-Nearest Neighbors (or KNN) technique is used to 
									impute those missing values 
								</p>
								<h5>Example of imputing missing data</h5>
								<a href="../assets/images/projects/project3/missing1.png" class="image main"><img src="../assets/images/projects/project3/missing1.png" alt="" /></a><p></p>
								<a href="../assets/images/projects/project3/missing2.png" class="image main"><img src="../assets/images/projects/project3/missing2.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The next step is to create transform the response variable osteo.group from text to numerical 0, 1, 2 representing normal, osteopenia or osteoporosis. </p>
                                
                                <h4>3.2 Exploratory data analysis</h4>
								<p>The EDA process utilizes the techniques of descriptive statistics to analyze the dataset with visual elements before the modelling task.</p>
								<h5>Example of osteo groups </h5>
								<a href="../assets/images/projects/project3/osteo_grp.png" class="image main"><img src="../assets/images/projects/project3/osteo_grp.png" alt="" /></a><p></p>
								<h5>Example of distribution shape of dataset features </h5>
								<a href="../assets/images/projects/project3/distribution.png" class="image main"><img src="../assets/images/projects/project3/distribution.png" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The histogram indicates all features appear to be approximately normal distribution except for the age feature which is right skewed. Osteo group is not in scope due to nominal variable.</p>
								<h5>Example of outlier detection</h5>
								<a href="../assets/images/projects/project3/outlier.png" class="image main"><img src="../assets/images/projects/project3/outlier.png" alt="" /></a><p></p>
								<h4>3.3 Machine learning model</h4>
								<p>In this project, to predict the possibility of being suffered from osteoporosis disease, which are multiple outcomes i.e. normal, osteopenia or osteoporosis, multinomial logistic regression and random forest algorithm are adopted</p>
								<h4>3.4 Performance evaluation</h4>
								<h3>4. Conclusion of findings:</h3>
