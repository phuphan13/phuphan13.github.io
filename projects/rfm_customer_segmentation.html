                                <p>
                                This project demonstrates how to perform customer analysis on a historical, transactional database using the RFM based segmentation. 
                                <b>RFM</b> stands for <b>Recency, Frequency and Monetary</b>, which is one of the common techniques used in CRM to
                                category customers into similar and different groups. This project utilizes Northwind database, the popular sample
                                was originally created by Microsoft. Asuze Data Studio and Python are used to create RFM metrics, scores, analysis and visualization. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>2. Dataset introduction</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The <b>Northwind</b> database contains sales data for a company called Northwind Traders, which imports
                                    and exports specialty foods around the world. This sample database was originally come with Microsoft
                                    Office suite, but Microsoft also shared the script to create a Northwind data sample in SQL Management tool, 
                                    which can be accessed via this <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs" target="_blank">link</a>.

                                    For RFM analysis, this project ultilizes the script to create a sample database and only use three main tables 
                                    such as: <b>Customers</b>, <b>Orders</b> and <b>Order Details</b>.

                                <h3>3. RFM Analysis</h3>
								<h4>3.1 What is RFM Analysis</h4>
								<p>
									RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a marketing technique to explore the behavior based 
									customer segmentation, in which this technique combines three different factors to rank each individual 
									customer, and assign them into various segments. This can help the company in arranging appropriate
									treaments for each group of customers, such as offering incentives for VIP customers, promotions for 
									loyal customers, and separate plans for those who are at risk of being lost as they haven't purchased a long time ago. 
									The three factors are defined as following:

									<ul>
										<li><b>Recency:</b> how long (many day ago) a customer has purchased? 1 day ago, 14 days or 100 days ago?</li>
										<li><b>Frequency:</b> how often (many times) they purchased? It can be how many orders over a defined period </li>
										<li><b>Monetary:</b> how much the customer spent? It can be total sales from all transaction over a defined period</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<h4>
									3.2 Calculating RFM scores
								</h4>
								<p>Different businesses can define a scale of scores, for example, a score of 1 to 3 can be 
								   assigned to each factor recency, frequency and monetary, in which 3 is the best/highest value and 1 is the 
								   worst/lowest value for measurement. A final RFM score is calculated by combining three value of R/F/M above. 
								   <h5>Example of FRM scores table</h5>
								   <a href="../assets/images/projects/project7/northwind_rfmscore.jpg" class="image main"><img src="../assets/images/projects/project7/northwind_rfmscore.jpg" alt="" /></a><p></p>
								</p>
								<p>
									Given the valuation date of 10 May 1998, a customer with ID of "ALFKI" has purchase 31 days ago, this customer has
									placed 6 orders and total sales is roughly 4,596$, the R/F/M scores are 2/1/2 respectively. First, the recency of 
									all customers are sorted in ascending order, then the top 1/3 part of the list will be assigned 3 (highest score),
									the next 1/3 part and the last 1/3 part will have 2 and 1 (lowest score) respectively. Frequency and Monetary are done 
									using the same logic but in descending order. This is because the more frequent and larger sales will likely represent 
									a loyal customer.
								</p>
								<p>
									The approach above divide the customer list into 3 tiers, it also can be divided into 4 tiers (quartile), or 5 tiers (quintile) or
									percentile depending on the modelling requirements and business complexity. Another method to define the tiers is using 
									the fixed ranges. For example, if someone purchased within 15 days, assign 3, more than 15 days but less than 40 days,
									assign 2, and score 1 assign to the rest customers. Frequency and monetary can also be applied this method. 
								</p>
								<h4>
									3.3 Segmentation of RFM scores
								</h4>
								<p>
									Given the scale of 3 tiers, total customer segments is 27 (or 3x3x3). Likewise, the case of 4 tiers results in 64 distinct 
									segments (4x4x4). However, it is unnecessary to have so many segments , so marketers should assemble groups of customers and 
									what segments most relevant to the business. Below is a list of customer segements that can be used. 
									<ul>
										<li><b>Champion:</b> who purchase most recently, often and spend most, FRM score 333, 332... </li>
										<li><b>Loyal customer:</b> who not always spent the most, not quite often but always come back, FRM score 232...</li>
										<li><b>Potential loyalist:</b> who not purchase quite often but biggest spenders, FRM score 113, 123...</li>
										<li><b>New customer:</b> who has made initial purchases, either spend most or not, FRM score 313, 312, 311...</li>
										<li>...</li>
										<li><B>Lost customer:</b> who hasn't purchased in some time, FRM score 111, 112, 113...</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
                               	<h3>4. Implementation:</h3>	
								<p>
									In this project, <b>Azure Data Studio</b> is used to connect to SQL Server, first executing the script to create database Northwind,
									then creating FRM scores based on three tables Customers, Orders, and Order Details. Valuation date is set to 10 May 1998 but 
									can be changed. Python package <b>pyodbc</b> is used to manage the SQL server connection and execute scripts, <b>plotly</b> is used for explanatory
									analysis and data visualization.
